# Instructions

(I'd recommend doing the first exercise as it will hopefully increase your
understanding of the routing mechanism in Express, and routing in general).

For this exercise you are going to create a mini JSON API with the web framework
Express (https://expressjs.com).

This exercise has two parts: the first part is creating a regular HTML page
(with some minor CSS and JS) and the second part is the JSON API.

## Part 1:

Create a route ("/") that serves the user with an HTML page. This page should
include some CSS and JS. The amount of CSS and JS is up to you, as long as the
users are able to visit the page and have CSS and JS being served from your
server thats enough. Which means the contents of this page could mearly be
copied from another site, just so you get some text that you can style (CSS) and
perhaps some button that does something (JS).

## Part 2:

This part will consist of you creating a mini JSON API. All of the data should
be stored within a local JSON file (the implementation for this is up to you).

* Route
    - GET "/users", this should return an array of users (not all properties, only
      the username and id for each user)
    - GET "/users/:id", this should return a user (all properties)
    - POST "/users", this should create a new user and then return the user
      (including the newly generated id)
    - PUT "/users/:id", this should edit the properties of a user and then
      return the edited user
    - DELETE "/users/:id", this should delete a user and only return the id

All changes (POST, PUT and DELETE) should also be made in the JSON file.

A user should have the following properties:

User { id, username, email, phone }

Testing your API can be cumbersome, I'd recommend using an App for sending and
receiveing requests more easily. For example:

Good luck!
